## Install Lua
```
curl -L http://git.io/lenv | perl
```

and then adding:

```source ~/.lenvrc```

to .bash_profile (Mac OS X) or .bashrc (Ubuntu).

This will let you install many versions of Lua side-by-side. Full documentation is available at the lenv project page, but this will install lua 5.3, luarocks for 5.3, the busted test framework, and the luacov coverage tool:

```lenv fetch
lenv install 5.3.4
lenv use 5.3.4
luarocks install busted
```
